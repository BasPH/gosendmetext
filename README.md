# Gosendmetext

A Golang rewrite of [https://github.com/BasPH/sendmetext], a small Bash CLI tool for sending text to a given address.

Main purpose of this rewrite is learning Golang, however the CLI itself can be useful for testing purposes. I sometimes use it for testing data flowing through telnet (streaming APIs often use [telnet examples](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html#quick-example)).
