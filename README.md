# Sendmetext

A rewrite of [https://github.com/BasPH/sendmetext], a small Bash CLI tool for sending text to a given location.

Main purpose of this rewrite is learning Golang, however the CLI itself can be useful for testing purposes. I sometimes use it for testing data flowing through telnet ports.
